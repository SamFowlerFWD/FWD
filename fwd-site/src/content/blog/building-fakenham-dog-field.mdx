## The Brief

Fakenham Dog Field is a brand new secure dog exercise field at Fakenham Racecourse. The owner needed a booking and payment system ready for launch, with one twist: the field is behind a Paxton-controlled gate, so customers need a valid access code to get in.

The requirements were pretty clear from the start:

- Let customers book and pay online, any time of day
- Automatically generate and send a gate access code after payment
- Keep it simple, no app downloads, no account creation

We looked at off-the-shelf booking platforms first, but none of them could handle the Paxton gate integration the way we needed. The ones that came close would have been expensive to customise and still wouldn't have done exactly what we wanted. So we built it from scratch.

## What We Built

We built a custom booking system from scratch, deployed on Cloudflare Pages. It handles everything from browsing available slots to receiving a gate code, with nothing manual in between.

### How It Works

1. **Customer picks a date and time** on the calendar, which shows available slots based on operating hours and existing bookings
2. **Customer enters their details** like name, email, and phone number
3. **Payment goes through Stripe** with a secure card payment, no account needed
4. **Access code gets generated** by the system talking to the Paxton access control API to create a time-limited code
5. **Confirmation email goes out** with the booking details and gate code

The whole thing takes under two minutes from start to finish.

## Key Features

**Smart availability checking** so the system prevents double-bookings by checking existing reservations and blocked dates in real-time. Operating hours are configurable per day of the week.

**Stripe integration** where payments are handled securely through Stripe, with webhook confirmation to make sure the booking is only confirmed after successful payment.

**Paxton API integration** which was the interesting bit. The Paxton access control system manages the physical gate lock. After payment, the system calls the Paxton API to generate a unique access code that only works during the booked time window.

**Admin dashboard** so the field owner can view bookings, manage availability, block dates for maintenance, and see revenue reports.

**Email notifications** with automated confirmation emails including booking details and the gate access code, plus reminders before the session.

## How It's Going

The system has been running reliably since launch:

- **Fully self-service** so every booking happens without anyone needing to get involved
- **Open 24/7** so customers book whenever it suits them
- **No access issues** because the automated codes just work
- **Minimal admin** for the owner, who can focus on running the field rather than chasing bookings

## Tech Stack

The project was built with a focus on speed, reliability, and low running costs:

- **Frontend**: Custom-built with modern JavaScript
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages (fast, global CDN)
- **Payments**: Stripe (checkout sessions + webhooks)
- **Access Control**: Paxton Cloud API integration
- **Database**: Serverless database for bookings and availability
- **Email**: Transactional email service for confirmations

The whole system runs with minimal hosting costs thanks to Cloudflare and serverless architecture.

This project is a good example of how a focused custom build can solve a real problem better than an off-the-shelf solution. The Paxton integration alone, automating physical access control from an online booking, isn't something you'd find in a standard booking plugin.

If you've got something similar where online actions need to trigger real-world systems, [get in touch](/services/custom-app-development). There's a good chance it can be automated.
