## The Brief

Rachael and Molly run Salon 64, a hair salon at 64 Norwich Street in Dereham town centre. They had a growing team of stylists and a solid reputation locally, but no real online presence. When people searched for hairdressers in Dereham, they weren't showing up.

They needed a website that:

- Looked professional and showed off their work
- Helped them get found on Google for local searches
- Listed their services clearly so customers knew what to expect
- Was easy to update with new gallery photos

## What We Built

A single-page website that loads fast and covers everything a potential customer needs to know: services, gallery, team, location, opening hours, and FAQs.

### Services Section

The site breaks down their services into four clear categories: haircuts, colouring, styling, and treatments. Each one lists what's included so customers can see at a glance what's on offer. This also helps with SEO because it gives Google real content to index rather than just a list of prices.

### Gallery

A big part of selling a hair salon is showing the actual work. The gallery features photos of real clients, which builds trust and gives people a feel for the salon's style. The images are optimised for fast loading without sacrificing quality.

### Team Page

Customers want to know who will be doing their hair. The site introduces each stylist with a photo and their role, from the owners Rachael and Molly through to the trainees. It makes the salon feel approachable and personal.

### FAQ Section

We added a detailed FAQ section covering the questions people actually search for: "Do I need to book?", "Is there parking?", "Do you do wedding hair?" Each answer is written to be genuinely helpful while also targeting the kind of queries people type into Google.

## The SEO Approach

This is where the real value was. A good-looking website that nobody finds is just a digital business card. We wanted Salon 64 to actually show up when people search for hairdressers in the area.

**Local SEO fundamentals** including proper meta tags, structured data markup for the business (address, opening hours, services), and geo-tagging so search engines know exactly where the salon is and what it does.

**Content that answers real questions** because the FAQ section and service descriptions aren't just filler. They target the actual phrases people search for, things like "hairdresser Dereham", "balayage Dereham", and "wedding hair Norfolk".

**Fast loading times** since Google rewards speed. The site is lightweight, with optimised images and no unnecessary bloat. It loads quickly on mobile, which is where most people search for local services.

**Proper image alt text** on every photo, describing what's shown. This helps with image search results and accessibility.

## Tech Stack

Simple and effective:

- **Frontend**: Hand-coded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages (fast, global CDN)
- **Images**: Optimised WebP format for fast loading
- **SEO**: Schema.org structured data, Open Graph tags, geo-meta tags

No WordPress, no page builders, no monthly CMS fees. Just a clean, fast website that does exactly what it needs to do.

## Results

The site gives Salon 64 a proper online presence that works for them around the clock. Customers can find them on Google, see their work, check opening hours, and call to book, all without anyone at the salon needing to do anything.

Local businesses like hair salons often get pushed towards template website builders or overpriced "digital marketing" packages. Most of the time, what they actually need is a well-built website with solid SEO fundamentals. Nothing flashy, just the right content in the right place so Google can do its job.
