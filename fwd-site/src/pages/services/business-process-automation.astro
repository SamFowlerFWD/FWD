const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is business process automation?",
    answer: "Business process automation means using technology to handle repetitive tasks that you currently do manually. This includes things like generating invoices, sending follow-up emails, moving data between systems, and scheduling. Instead of spending hours on routine work, the automation handles it for you, accurately and consistently."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does automation cost?",
    answer: "Simple automations start from £799. This covers 1-3 process automations for small businesses, including setup, testing, and 30 days of support. More complex projects involving multiple systems or custom workflows start from £3,000. I always provide a fixed quote before starting, so there are no surprises."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to set up?",
    answer: "Simple automations can typically be set up within 1-2 weeks. More complex projects involving multiple systems or custom integrations usually take 3-6 weeks. I'll give you an honest timeline based on your specific needs during our initial conversation."
  },
  {
    question: "What tasks can be automated?",
    answer: "Most repetitive tasks can be automated. Common examples include invoice generation, payment reminders, email follow-ups, data entry between systems, report generation, appointment scheduling, customer enquiry routing, and stock management. If you're doing the same thing over and over, there's usually a way to automate it."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need technical knowledge to use the automation?",
    answer: "No. I build automations that work in the background without you needing to do anything. Where there is a user interface, I design it to be straightforward and provide full training. I also include a support period after setup to make sure everything runs smoothly."

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Business automation is ideal for small business owners, tradespeople, and growing companies who find themselves spending too much time on admin. If you're manually creating invoices, copying data between spreadsheets, sending the same emails repeatedly, or managing bookings by hand, automation can give you that time back.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I've built automations for businesses across Norfolk and the UK, from sole traders to companies with 20+ staff. The common thread is simple: they had repetitive tasks eating into their day, and now technology handles those tasks instead.
