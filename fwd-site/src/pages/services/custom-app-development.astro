  {
    question: "How much does a custom app cost?",
    answer: "Custom apps start from £1,299 for simpler projects like MVPs and straightforward tools. Full-featured applications with multiple integrations, user roles, and complex business logic start from £5,000. Every project gets a fixed quote before we start, so you know exactly what you're paying."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does app development take?",
    answer: "It depends on the complexity. Simpler projects typically take 3-5 weeks, while full-featured applications with complex requirements take 6-12 weeks. I share progress regularly so you can see the app taking shape and provide feedback throughout the build."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build mobile apps?",
    answer: "Yes. I build cross-platform mobile apps for iOS and Android, as well as web applications that work in any browser. The right approach depends on your needs. Sometimes a responsive web app is better than a native app, and I'll advise honestly on what makes sense for your project."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I own the code?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. You get full source code ownership with every project. There's no vendor lock-in. If you ever want to move to a different developer, you can take everything with you. I also provide documentation so anyone can pick up where I left off."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide ongoing support after launch?",
    answer: "Yes. Every project includes a post-launch support period. After that, I offer hosting and maintenance plans from £99/month that cover updates, bug fixes, and new features as your business grows. Many of my clients have been with me for years."

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Custom app development is for businesses that have outgrown spreadsheets and off-the-shelf tools. If you're managing bookings by phone, tracking inventory on paper, or cobbling together multiple systems that don't talk to each other, a custom app can bring everything together in one place.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          I've built apps for businesses across Norfolk and the UK, from booking systems for dog fields and horsebox hire companies to mentorship platforms with thousands of users. Whether you need a simple internal tool or a customer-facing platform, I can help.
