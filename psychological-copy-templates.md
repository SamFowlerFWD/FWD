Hi [Name],

Quick question: Did you know [Competitor] just launched an AI customer service?

They're responding to customers in seconds. 
At 2am. 
On Sundays.
Perfectly.

While your customers wait.

This isn't fair. But it's reality.

Want to level the playing field?

[Calculate Your AI Advantage]

Sarah
P.S. 2 more Norfolk businesses start AI this week. Will you be one?
```

### Email 2: Success Possibility

```
[Name],

Met James from Norwich Bakery yesterday.

8 weeks ago: 60-hour weeks, stressed, missing family time.
Today: 10 strategic hours, AI handles operations, opening location #3.

What changed? 
He stopped competing manually.
Started competing with AI.

Same bakery. Same recipes. 
10x less work. 3x more revenue.

Your turn?

[See Your Transformation Timeline]

Sarah
P.S. James started with just customer service AI. Small step, massive impact.
```

### Email 3: Urgency Creation
**Subject:** "Your competitors thank you"
```
[Name],

Every day you wait, competitors gain:
- 8 automated hours
- 47 perfect customer responses

February has 2 spots left.
March is booking.

When do you stop falling behind?

[Book Your February Spot]

Sarah

## REMEMBER: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EVERY WORD

1. **Identity Before Action:** "As an innovative SMB owner" not "Become innovative"
2. **Loss Before Gain:** "Stop losing £347 daily" not "Start saving £347 daily"
3. **Specific Before General:** "3 Norwich competitors" not "Many competitors"
4. **Now Before Later:** "Start Monday" not "Get started soon"
5. **Them Before You:** "Your competitors gain..." not "You could gain..."

Every word either moves toward action or away from it.
Choose words that bypass analysis and trigger action.

This is how Apple sells without selling.
How Nike motivates without preaching.
How Tesla creates desire without desperation.

Now it's how FWD transforms UK SMBs.
